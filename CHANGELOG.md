## Development Notes

### Working Implementations
- **Primary**: `/kiosk/play` - Full-featured kiosk experience
- **Alternative**: `/kiosk/working` - Simplified working version
- **Test**: `/kiosk/simple` - Basic functionality verification

### Known Limitations
- Component CSS modules may have loading issues in some configurations
- Export script requires system-level puppeteer and FFmpeg installation
- 360° viewer dependent on external Foot Locker CDN availability

### Future Enhancements Considered
